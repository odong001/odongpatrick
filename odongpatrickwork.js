// OOP
// Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concepts of Objects.
// That means everything that we achieve in OOP language is through objects here object defines the real-world entities like Student or Car (More detail soon).
// By using OOP, you make sure that only allowed members of one code is accessible to others. That makes your code fully secured to unauthenticated access (within the code).
// example.
